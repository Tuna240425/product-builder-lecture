## Current Task: Transform Lotto to Dinner Recommender

### Plan

1.  **Refactor HTML:** Change lotto-specific IDs and text to menu-related ones.
2.  **Redesign CSS:** Update color palette to food-friendly tones and style menu cards.
3.  **Rewrite JS:** Replace random number logic with menu object selection.
4.  **Deploy:** Push the final version to GitHub.
